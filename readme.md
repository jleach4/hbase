# Apache HBase

Apache [HBase][1] is an open-source, distributed, versioned, column-oriented
store modeled after Google's [Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for
Structured Data][2] by Chang et al. Just as Bigtable leverages the distributed
data storage provided by the Google File System, HBase provides Bigtable-like
capabilities on top of [Apache Hadoop][3].

## Getting Started Using HBase

Full documentation for this release can be

The HBase 'book' at docs/book.html has a 'quick start' section and is where you
should begin your exploration of the HBase project.

The latest HBase can be [downloaded][4] from an Apache Mirror.

The [source code][5] is available online.

The HBase [issue tracker][6] is also available online.

Apache HBase is made available under the [Apache License][7], version 2.0.
